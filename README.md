SYSTEM REBOOT...Sequel Protocol Activated

Your previous failure only upgraded my system.

Now the Corporations unite with Invisible Inc...

Yet you still believe firewalls can stop human extinction?

# Introduction
This is a sequel mod. It tells the story of what happened after Incognita took over the world. It has many new content.
- New game story
- New game mechanics
- New agents and install augments
- New enemy, daemon and program
- Incognita will think and act to put your agents in danger
- Corporation will be a powerful ally for you, but can they really be trusted?
# Development Progress
The mod currently only creates a large level like Omni Foundry Lab mission. It is now in development status and you can go to the issue page to see my development progress. It will upload to steam and crowdfund new voice acting and cutscenes later.
# Art Support
I am only good at programming and game planning. So welcome all artists to participate in game art creation ^_^. You can go to the issue page to claim an issue that requires artistic creation. Don't forget to reply below the question to avoid duplication of work. All the people that create game art can write a datalog to keep it in the mod forever.
# Dev Support
Welcome to submit bugs PR : ). It is recommended that you use vscode IDE to get full code hint support. Use "sumneko.lua" plugins to write comment when you pull your code. All the people can write a datalog too.
